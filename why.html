    <h1>My Goals</h1>
    <ol>
      <li><h3>Why do I want to learn this skill?</h3>
      <p>It will prove to myself that I can learn new skills in my old age.</p></li>
      <li><h3>What will I achieve if I learn this skill?</h3>
      <p>I will open a door to a new future that I thought was beyond me. Hopefully, it will enable me to work better hours in better places, maybe even remotely from home.</p></li>
      <li><h3>How will this skill change my life and my career?</h3>
      <p>I will be happier in my life working for an IT firm instead of sweating or freezing to death in a factory making JCB's getting no satisfaction whatsoever.</p></li>
      <li><h3>How will learning this skill impact the lives of my family,
      friends and coworkers?</h3>
      <p>I am sure that my family and friends would be happy for me to make progress in my life, but maybe my coworkers will miss me a little.</p>
      <p>Gaining respect from anyone is an impressive feat and would be an added bonus if I did manage to acquire any.</p></li>
      <li><h3>How will I feel if I never accomplish this?</h3>
      <p>Gutted, a failure, deluded, devoid of hope and suicidal every time I get up before light to go to work in a factory.</p></li>
      <li><h3>What would my life look like if I manage to accomplish this?</h3>
      <p>Everyday would put a smile on my face knowing I didn't have to work in a place that I hate. I would be doing something that was challenging and giving me satisfaction. Doing something I enjoy, not just going through the same routines. I would definitely be a happier and more friendly person.</p>
      <p>Any monetary gains are second, but would be a very welcome bonus if acquired.</p></li>
    </ol>
